The project that I've chosen to do is a QR Code Generator. 
It essentially asks the user to input a url to a website and the QR Code for that corresponding website is generated. 

I have used python and flask as the primary programming languages.

I have primarily used 3 Azure resources - 

1) Azure Blob Storage bucket -
This is used to store the generated QR Code images and display the same on the website.
The same file name is chosen every time a user asks to generate the QR Code, so it essentially overwrites the image every time it generates a new image.


2) Azure Virtual Machine - 
Used to deploy and host the application on an Azure VM.

3) Azure Monitor -
Used to monitor and get an in-site on the overall performance, health etc. 


Want to use - 
Azure Chatbot - 
In the future iteration of the project, i want to include the Azure Chatbot services directly on the website to handle user questions
